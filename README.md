# alpha-aligner

*work in progress...*

pairwise alignment cli tool that (*will*) supports local and global alignmnents.



usage: `python main.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--type {protein,dna,rna}] [--penalty PENALTY] [--algorithm {SW,NW}] [--dotplot -d] seqA seqB`

`seqA` and `seqB` - paths to fasta files

`--penalty PENALTY` - penalty for gap opening, default -8

`--output OUTPUT` - doesn't work yet

`--type {protein,dna,rna}` - doesn't work yet

`--dotplot -d` - doesn't work yet

`--algorithm {SW,NW}` - currently doesn't work, NW is the default now
