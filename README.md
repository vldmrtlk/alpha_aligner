usage: main.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--type {protein,dna,rna}] [--penalty PENALTY] [--algorithm {SW,NW}] [--dotplot -d] seqA seqB

seqA and seqB - paths to fasta files

[--penalty PENALTY] - penalty for gap oppening, default -8

[--output OUTPUT] - doesn't work yet

[--type {protein,dna,rna}] - doesn't work yet

[--dotplot -d] - doesn't work yet

[--algorithm {SW,NW}] - currently doesn't work, NW is the default now
